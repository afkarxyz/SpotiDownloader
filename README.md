## FAQ

### Is this software free?

_Yes. This software is completely free.
You do not need an account, login, or subscription.
All you need is an internet connection._

### Can using this software get my Spotify account suspended or banned?

_No.
This software has no connection to your Spotify account.
Spotify data is obtained through reverse engineering of the Spotify Web Player, not through user authentication._

### Where does the audio come from?

_The audio is fetched using third-party APIs._

### Why does metadata fetching sometimes fail?

_This usually happens because your IP address has been rate-limited.
You can wait and try again later, or use a VPN to bypass the rate limit._

### Why does Windows Defender or antivirus flag or delete the file?

_This is a false positive.
It likely happens because the executable is compressed using UPX._

_If you are concerned, you can fork the repository and build the software yourself from source._

### Why does the app sometimes fail to obtain a token?

_The target website uses Cloudflare protection.
The app attempts to bypass it using ChromeDriver, which may require multiple retries._

### Why do I get a 500 error when a download fails?

_A 500 error indicates a server-side issue.
This is outside of my control._
